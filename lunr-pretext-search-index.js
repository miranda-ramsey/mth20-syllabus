Emails sent on weekdays will be answered within 24 hours. Emails sent over a weekend or holiday will be answered the following scheduled school day.    Office Hours  I have scheduled office hours where you can come see me in person, or we can schedule a Zoom appointment as needed. I encourage you to come to office hours whenever you need additional help.

I strongly believe that this is not true, and that more people are capable of mathematics than we give credit to. My goal is to facilitate creativity and discovery, rather than simply dictating facts and procedures to memorize. In my lectures I set out to establish a question that can ground us and give us context for the math we are working with, and through group work students will be encouraged to talk through problems, ask for help, and lift each other up.    Weekly Structure  To perform best in the class, each week you should:   Read Ahead  Read the textbook material ahead of the days we will be covering it in class, so that you can ask questions and get clarification during lectures and group work.    Do Homework As We Go  Work on the homework throughout the week, rather than waiting until the end of the week. This way, challenging problems can be brought up in class with me or with your group.    Come to Office Hours  Visit me in Office Hours to fill in gaps in your understanding, before they become stressful issues.

  "body": " Class Materials   Textbook  For this class we will be using Basic College Mathematics (Third Edition) . Most of the structure of the class will be built around chapters 1-6, with chapters 7-11 used as references for applications throughout the term.  Purchase this book at the PCC book store.     Supplies    Pencils and Erasers. Mistakes happen in math, and trying to correct mistakes made with an ink pen is challenging and creates messy work.    A 1-inch, 3-ring binder for organizing your Workbook activities and notes, unless using a digital alternative.     Graph Paper for notes and assignments. My favorite choice is Engineering Paper , which is constructed to have faint lines on the front for a clean appearance, but any graph paper will do.      Technology    Regular access to D2L (Desire2Learn) will be required to access materials and submit assignments for this class. Please visit the technology support section of Student Support Resources for a complete list of apps and tools for PCC students.    A personal scientific calculator such as a TI-30XS may be helpful for this class, but is not required.     "

  "body": " Attendance   Attendance Policy  Attendance and participation are crucial to succeed in a math course. In this class, Group Work will be a large component, so students are expected to attend class and collaborate with each other. Credit for group work will not be given if students are absent or not participating.  However, I understand that perfect attendance is not a practical expectation. If you must miss class, please email me to let me know, and I will work with you to make sure you keep up and that your grade is minimally affected.    First Week Activities  During the first week of the term, instructors must identify students who are enrolled but not engaged in a class. These are referred to as \"No Show\" students and will be dropped from the class as per PCC's G302 Grading Guidelines Policy.   In order to avoid being dropped as a \"No Show\" student, you must complete the following activities by their deadlines:     Attend and participate in class during the first week (Monday, March 31 and Wednesday, April 2)    Complete the MTH 20 Student Introduction form before class Wednesday, April 2.

Workbook Activities  For each class session there is an associated workbook activity. For most activities, there is a prep-work portion, a group-work portion, and a post-work reflection portion. It is your responsibility to arrive to class with the prep work completed so that you can fully participate with your group. The workbook will be turned in with a self assessment before each Exam.    Quizzes  There will be seven quizzes, each administered on a Wednesday at the start of class and covering material from the week before.   Quiz Corrections: After your graded quiz is returned, you may redo the quiz in its entirety and submit it as a Quiz Correction. Your final grade will be an average of your two submissions, meaning you can recover up to half of your missed points by submitting a quiz correction. For example, if you score a 6\/10 on a quiz, you may upgrade your score to an 8\/10 with a quiz correction.       Exams     Midterm Exam  There is one Midterm Exam in this class, administered on Wednesday, April 30. There will be no calculator allowed on this exam, as all of your work will need to be shown by hand.   Practice Midterm: One week before the Midterm, I will release a Practice Midterm. Working on it together with your group will be one of the Workbook Activities, and you can make sure that you are prepared for the exam and support your classmates by preparing together.   Midterm Corrections: After your graded exam is returned, you may redo the exam in its entirety and submit it as a Midterm Correction. Your final grade will be an average of your two submissions, meaning you can recover up to half of your missed points by submitting a Midterm correction. For example, if you score a 74% on the exam, you may upgrade your score to an 87% with a midterm correction.    Final Exam  There is one Final Exam in this class, administered on Wednesday, June 11. There will be limited calculator use allowed on this exam. Unfortunately, since the Final will be during our last class meeting, there is no opportunity for a Final Correction.   Practice Final: One week before the Final, I will release a Practice Final. Working on it together with your group will be one of the Workbook Activities, and you can make sure that you are prepared for the exam and support your classmates by preparing together.       Late Work and Make-Up Policy  Mathematics is a subject that builds on itself, so it is crucial that you stay on top of your work at the pace of the class. However, I understand that life does not always line up with college schedules and deadlines. If you need more time to complete a homework assignment, or if you need to miss class, please contact me (see ) to work out an extension, or another way to make up work.     "

The Handbook establishes students' freedoms and protections as well as the expectations of appropriate behavior and ethical academic work. The Handbook includes items such as the Policy on Student Rights, and the Student Code of Conduct Policy and Procedures.    Academic Integrity  The handbook contains the Code of Student Conduct and the Academic Integrity Policy. Cheating includes any attempt to defraud, deceive, or mislead the instructor in arriving at an honest grade assessment, and may include copying answers from other students or using unauthorized notes during tests. Plagiarism is a particular form of cheating that involves presenting as one's own the ideas or work of another and may include using other people's ideas without proper attribution and submitting another person's work as one's own. Dishonest activities such as cheating on exams and submitting or copying work donw by others will result in disciplinary actions including but not limited to receiving a failing grade. For further information, review the institution's Academic Integrity Policy.     Artificial Intelligence Statement  The use of generative AI and Language Learning Models in this course such as, but not limited to ChatGPT, should be used only if it does not otherwise violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the College. Such violations include turning in work that is not your own.  In this class specifically, while generative AI and language learning models can be excellent tools for summarizing and presenting information, leaning on such tools when you are yourself trying to learn something, even in ways that seem to be academically honest, can instill a dependency that is really challenging to let go of later. I highly recommend avoiding the use of tools like ChatGPT, even as a study assistant! Please ask me for help instead.     Internet Etiquette   Click here for more information about Internet Etiquette (or Netiquette).     Sanctuary College Statement  PCC is a sanctuary college. For more information and resources, see the resources for undocumented students page.     Inclement Weather Statement  Our course is typically unaffected by college campus and facility closures or delayed class start times. Our regular due dates [and Zoom class meeting times (if a remote class)] apply. However, if PCC must close all operations, our regular due dates will be adjusted accordingly. Please check your email for my instructions and continue to check Brightspace during closures.    Flexibility Statement  The instructor reserves the right to modify course content and\/or substitute assignments and learning activities in response to institutional, weather, or class situations.
